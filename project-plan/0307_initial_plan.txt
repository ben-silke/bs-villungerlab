title: "Aims/ initial pipeline ideas"

The aim of the project is to attempt to merge the repeats, and the two experiements to increase the signal/ decrease noise and determine differentially expressed genes within each of the treatments and the time points.


input data:
potentially (yet to confirm) unaligned sequence reads in BAM format.


thoughts of pipeline:
1. merge data (reads in bam format)
2. align sequences
3. exclude rRNA / non- mRNA reads. the amount of exclusion should be varied, initially being conservative and then being harser - but just important to record what type of excluding parameters are used.
4. run subsequent analysis. see dario-past/dario_pipeline.txt
