## qPCR
Functional Primers:
BMF
ARID5B
CDC25A
NINJ1
SQSTM1
GAPDH

1. qPCR with old primers (ZM_19, ZM_old, noc_old, noc_p5)
2. (when primers arrive) test new primers
3. pcr with primers
5. qPCR with new primers (noc_new, noc_+, ZM_19, ZM_old, noc_old, noc_p5)

needed:
1. password for the qPCR machine (account)
2. install 


## Tissue Culture
Thursday:
1. Treat RPE1/ A459/ Nalm6 (done)
2. Move Nalm6 to t75 with +8ml RPM1 (Done)
3. 

Friday:
1. Collect RPE1 / A459 / Nalm6 cells @ 1030am
    Confirm: where are the cells are (RPE1/ A459)
Collection protocol:
adherent cells: wash 1x with PBS (1ml/well), remove, 200ul trypsin, incubation for ˜5min @37°C. Add 1ml DMEM/well, collect and transfer in 1.5ml Eppendorf tube.
                Spin down for 3 min @500rcf, remove supernatant, add 1ml PBS/Eppendorf, spin down for 3mins at 500rcf. Remove superanatant, store at -80
Suspension cells: collect into an eppendorf tube, Spin down for 3 min @500rcf, remove supernatant, add 1ml PBS/Eppendorf, spin down for 3mins at 500rcf. Remove superanatant, store at -80


Monday:
1. Seed new experiment (9am)
    a. RPE1 / A459 4*10^5 cells per well . same template (4wells for RNA + 4wells for WB for each cell line) as first, but double the cells (its 400.000 instead of 300.000)
    b. Nalm6 - 6 well plate (4*10^6 cells / well (2ml)) for Western Blot +
                        12well plate (1,5*10^6 cells/well, 1ml/well, 4 wells per cell line) for RNA extraction
(what is the reason to seed/ treat on the same day? To save time. Suspension cells have no issues, adherent cells like RPE1 and A549 take relatively short to adhere, but the don’t have time to grow, that’s why I suggest to seed 400k instead of 300k cells/well, but before we did different days, yes, it’s just to save a bit of time)
2. Treat Cells (4/5pm)
3. Split RPE1 (1:12) / A459 (1:10); with trypsin (1ml) + DMEM (5ml wash; into relative amounts of DMEM). You do that as you detach the cells to seed the experiments

Tuesday:
1. Collect cells
Collection protocol:
adherent cells: wash 1x with PBS (1ml/well), remove, 200ul trypsin, incubation for ˜5min @37°C. Add 1ml DMEM/well, collect and transfer in 1.5ml Eppendorf tube.
                Spin down for 3 min @500rcf, remove supernatant, add 1ml PBS/Eppendorf, spin down for 3mins at 500rcf. Remove superanatant, store at -80
Suspension cells: collect into an eppendorf tube, Spin down for 3 min @500rcf, remove supernatant, add 1ml PBS/Eppendorf, spin down for 3mins at 500rcf. Remove superanatant, store at -80

Friday:
1. Split Nalm6 cells

needed: media without PBS.
