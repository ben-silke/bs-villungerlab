Tasks:
qPCR
1. Redo Noc qPCR with functional primers (noc_new, noc_+, noc_p7)
2. (when primers arrive) test new primers
3. pcr with primers
4. qPCR with old primers (ZM_19, ZM_old, noc_old, noc_p5)
5. qPCR with new primers (noc_new, noc_+, noc_p7, ZM_19, ZM_old, noc_old, noc_p5)


Tissue Culture
Thursday:
1. Treat RPE1/ A459/ Nalm6 (done)
2. Move Nalm6 to t75 with +8ml RPM1
3. 

Friday:
1. Collect RPE1 / A459 / Nalm6 cells @ 1030am
    Confirm: where are the cells are (RPE1/ A459)
2. 

Monday:
1. Seed new experiment (9am)
    a. RPE1 / A459 4*10^5 cells per well . same template (4+4) as first, but double the cells
    b. Nalm6 - 6 well plate (4*10^6 cells / well (2ml))
(what is the reason to seed/ treat on the same day?, but before we did different days)
2. Treat Cells (4/5pm)
3. Split RPE1 (1:12) / A459 (1:10); with trypsin (1ml) + DMEM (5ml wash; into relative amounts of DMEM)

Tuesday:
1. Collect cells

Friday:
1. Split Nalm6 cells
