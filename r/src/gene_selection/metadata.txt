These files will determine time series for the treatments for genes which have an adj_p value > 0.1 and an abs(log2 fold change) > 1.
i.e. statistically significant, and upregulation greater than double, or downregulation by more than half.
 
these files were written and will run on the data from the STAR gencode index, 
using the ENCODE recomended specificantions and then subsequent counts using htseq.
this method can be found in cluster/gencode_star and cluster/htseq-count.

the outputs which this produces are then used in cytoscape and iregulon for enrichement analysis to determine
motifs and transcription factors which are representative of this treatment.
